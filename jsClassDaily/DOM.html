    <!--DOM -document object model is appn programming interface that represents all ur html (document converted to object like the tree structure of the html which is understandable by the browser , 
        
        we are using dom every time the reason behind that is we want to intoduce functionalities , methods , dynamicity to our web page. and we can perform those activities using document object model)
        when ever we are using document that means we are using dom functionality.
    
        ---- dom in java script is used to manipulate the content and structure of the page
         
        *--dom is a feature ,by which we can  manipulate the content and structure of the page
          *-- by accesing the dom feature we can dynamically modify the content of the page. for eg: if we are using click event that is done dynamically only (i meant we can do some thing instantly)


     for eg : if u written some content in html then if u want to manipulate that  particular content using js then we can do it by using document keyword which is dom functionality.
     by accesing the dom feature we can dynamically modify the content of the page for eg: if we are using click event that is done dynamically only (i meant we can do some thing instantly)
   so i can dynamically modify the content of the page.i acn do multiple things like modifying the content of the page , u can change the style , lay out of the page 
   u can add something to the page and removing and adding some responsiveness to the user interactions , like events ,click ,double click. 

     What do you mean DOM?
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated

    What is an example of a DOM?
     For example, if you want to add a new button to a webpage, you would use JavaScript to create a new element and then use the DOM 
     to add that element to the webpage. Similarly, if you want to remove an element, you would use the DOM to find the element and then delete it.

    <div id="ele">
       <!-- AIT marathalli , batch 13/09/23-->
       <p>hello all </p>
    </div>

    <script>
        let element=document.getElementById('ele');
       // element.innerHTML="good morning";
       
    
       element.innerHTML="<h1>very good morning </h1>"
       element.innerText="good morningg verryyyy";
        //innerHTML is the property of dom,by using innerHTML we can dynamically change the content to the page ,
        //and we can dynamically manipulate thee content of the page 
        //one of the document object model is inner html.
        //similar to innerhtml we innertext and textcontent 
//so by using this Document object model we can dynamically change the content of the page
