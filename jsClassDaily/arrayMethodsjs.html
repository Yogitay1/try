       quetion:difference between push and unshift , and pop and shift

        Array Methods :
        discussing about predefined methods

       -push(); -  in push method ,the element will be added to the end of the array  
       -pop(); - it will delete the last element from the array 
       -unshift(): - in un shift method the element will be added to the start of the array 
       -shift(): - in shift method the element will delete the start of the array.
       -slice()- it will slice element or string into multiple peices
       -concat()
       -sort():-sort method gives the output as a dictionary order
       -splice(): with the help of splice method we can add an element from anywhere and can delete the element from anywhere 
       -map(): 
       -filter():
       -reduce():
       to know about map filter reduce method we need to  first understand about functions

      console.log(a.slice(2, 6));

      //concat():

      var c = [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14];

      var d = b.concat(c);
      console.log(d);
      // console.log(b.concat(c));

      //sort()
      var nums = [4, 21, 8, 14, 2, 11, 9, 1];

      //reverse() method
      // console.log(nums.reverse());
