        API:application programming interface.
        eg:if u want to create an account then we will get sign in form like name, email id ;before that there will be some options like sign in with google or sign in with instagram.then if i click on sign up with google then it will automatically signed with google account.because all infromation i have given in google so google will be having the entire data.
        itis due to API , so since google is hvng the entire data , so the website u are gng to use google API and fetch the data from the google data base.so instead of again writing and storing the data in that particular page ,it uses  google api to fetch the data from the google server and will collect all the data from there and it will give u access to login so with the help of api it can be done .
        eg:for eg if i created a ecommerce website assume that there are 1crore people , so then i need a strong database ,, so what i can do is instead of storing in my database i can directly allow the user to get loggin through google facebook ,that means i am not storing the database only neccesary things if i want to store i can ,but u r not storing entire things instead i am taking help of google api and facebook api to collect the data from the user through google or facebook database .
                  



        API: API is a set of rules and protocols that defines how two or more systems can communicate and interact with each other.

        -how can we fetch API?
        -fetch()-to get response from api we use fetch method ,when ever we fetch the data 
        when ever we fetch it hits the promisemi8 nj
        s7
        -then();
        -catch();   
    
        -as a front end we are only consuming data.

        -JSON:Java script object notation
        -PROMISE():a promise is an object that represents a value but that may not be available yet now , but will be resolved at some point of time .
                   a promise is used to  handle asynchronous operation 
                   -syncronous - the process will be line by line
                   -asyncronous- is opp to syncronous by using call baCK function.
        
        
        
        -pending
        -funfilled
        -reject
